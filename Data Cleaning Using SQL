-- Data Cleaning 
-- 1. Removing Duplicates
-- Step 1: Checking for duplicates 
SELECT ID, COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM customer.mtn_customer_churn
GROUP BY ID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 ;


-- Step 2: Creating a table 

CREATE TABLE churn_2 LIKE mtn_customer_churn; 
SELECT * 
FROM churn_2;

-- Step 3: Importing data into a table 
INSERT churn_2
SELECT *
FROM mtn_customer_churn; 


-- Step 4: Identifying duplicete using row_number 
SELECT *, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
PARTITION BY ID, FullName) AS row_num
FROM churn_2;

-- Step 5: Using CTE 
WITH duplicate_cte AS
(
SELECT *, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
PARTITION BY ID, FullName) AS row_num
FROM churn_2
)
SELECT *
FROM duplicate_cte
WHERE row_num > 1; 

-- Step 6: Creating table to include row_num 
CREATE TABLE churn_3 LIKE churn_2; 
ALTER TABLE churn_3 ADD row_num int; 

-- Step 7 Inserting data to include row_num 
INSERT INTO churn_3 
SELECT *, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
PARTITION BY ID, FullName) AS row_num
FROM churn_2;

-- Step 8 Removing Duplicate
DELETE 
FROM churn_3
WHERE row_num > 1;

SELECT *
FROM churn_3;

-- 2. Renaming Columns 
-- 3. Removing Unnecessary Columns 
-- 4. Extracting Data Plan from the Subscription Plan Column 
-- 5. Creating view

SELECT Locate('G', SubscriptionPlan), SubscriptionPlan
FROM customer.mtn_customer_churn;
CREATE VIEW view_churn AS
SELECT 
ID,
Age, 
State, 
MTNDevice AS mtn_device, 
Gender, 
SatisfactionRate AS satisfaction_rate, 
customerreview AS customer_review, 
customerchurnstatus AS customer_churn_status, 
customertenureinmonths AS tenure,
CAST(substring(SubscriptionPlan, 1, Locate('G', SubscriptionPlan)-1)AS DOUBLE) AS subscription_plan,
TotalRevenue AS total_revenue,
DataUsage AS data_usage,
reasonsforchurn AS reason_for_churn
FROM churn_3;
